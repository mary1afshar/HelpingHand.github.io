## Inspiration
2020 was a historical year that left an impact on us all. The BLM protests in America started a global movement, and brought much needed conversations about police brutality and the lack of community resources to the table. It shed light on flaws in policing systems not only in the United States, but in Canada as well. Since the year 2000, there have been over 416 fatal encounters with the RCMP. A CBC analysis reveals that more than 70 per cent of victims suffer from mental health and substance abuse problems. This made us think. What other resources and forms of support can people suffering from these causes make use of? How can they access them in a way that is safe and that would encourage them to contact again? That's how we came up with **Helping Hand**. Our mission is to provide a gateway to multiple government-standard helplines and community resources, notably in the areas of:
- Mental health crises
- Sexual assault
- Family violence/issues

People in mental health crisis, victims of sexual assault, and family violence are less likely to be comfortable calling the police and may not seek help. **Helping Hand** seeks to bridge the gap by guiding people in crisis to community services. 
Sometimes, a social worker or mental health specialist can better assist you than a police officer. Our mission is to provide a tool that not only provides real time guidance to users, but also direct them to alternative resources or emergency responders if they need. We're here to lend a helping hand, whilst spreading awareness about what other support forms are available in our communities. 

## What it does
**Helping Hand** is a voice-automated service that provides assistance in non-emergency situations. Through interactive voice-feedback, it provides step by step guidance to users, helping them manage their situation and letting them know what steps to take from there. For example, someone who has experienced sexual assault may use **Helping Hand** to better understand their situation and the options available to them. **Helping Hand** will provide immediate information on how to safely remove yourself from the situation, how to properly report the situation, and follow-up measures on how to get tested for STIs and access a rape kit. If the victim specifies that their health or safety is in immediate danger, **Helping Hand** will direct them to the proper authorities. The main focus of **Helping Hand** is to provide more information on what a victim's options and what steps must be taken on their end to best help them in their situation.
